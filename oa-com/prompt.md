After receiving the task, I started implementing it. First, I went to Figma and inserted the data and photos that we currently have. That is, how our platform looks now and the exact page that I need, namely the already open course, where there is a list of modules and lessons.

I wrote the approximate requirements that I want to see on the platform. That is, requirements 1 and 2, which are written in the following files. So, after the requirements, I went to look for some examples and links to understand what kind of design I like.

Having roughly understood what kind of design I like, I put everything together and went to the chat of GPT, Claude and Gemini to do some in-depth research. I provided all the information that I have, after which they created an in-depth research that was then used to create a clue.

I saved the pages of the sites that I came up with as photos that I saved in Figma. But after some time, I was given some corrections and additional information, namely this nio-ro section with the main points of the courses, where in the background there is a photo with a mascot, as well as a list of the main points that should be on the page - a block with recommended courses, and after that I again collected some materials and again started to make a rough plan of how I want the course page to look.

I developed a rough design, namely a wireframe of how I want this page to look, and wrote the requirements. The third option, after which I turned to Gemini, Claude and GPT-chat so that they could conduct in-depth research based on the new information.

After creating a request, I turned to various artificial intelligences to create a visual image of the page.

Having developed the penultimate design option, all the information was collected into a Figma project and presented to the team lead. After that, we had a main call, where I was given some corrections and vision for the page. Before creating the design itself, I contacted the developers, and they gave me some more information about what they thought about the comments, how it would be displayed. And after listening to their version, I created it so that the gyrosection would display a forum, that is, next to the number of students we would have a "Forum" field, and when we click on it, it would take us to the very bottom of the page, where we would have the heading "Course Forum", and we could add a comment, that is, give it a heading and write the comment itself and publish it, and below that - comments from other users, where we could either like this comment or provide a response. This is on the gyrosection, information about the list of students, that is, that we have a general list of students taking this course, how much time has passed, who has not started it, and who has only started it, but has not yet started studying. Information about progress, there should be something related to the mascot. There should also be a block with a video with the mascot, after which we should have large options with courses. That is, we have a module for this course in the form of shorts like on YouTube. I also developed two options for displaying the video: in the form of a regular block, where the video is, and a block with information that there will be a video, click on the button and it will be displayed in a modal version. I also prepared several options for the progress line and I developed the list of modules in two versions. That is, we have a large list of these modules. The first option is when you can click "Watch more", and we have a list of all modules going down, or another option where you need to click on the button at the top opposite the heading "Course modules", and it says "Total number of modules" and next to it are icons with scrolling through these modules. The next point that needed to be done was to display the lessons themselves in the form of a grid or list. Also, the point that should have been there was that each lesson should have a mark that is in this lesson, that is, a presentation, video or text. There should also be some function with comments.
After receiving the feedback, I made all these changes to the requirements, after which I went to generate the prompt again and create the visual, before creating the design itself, I contacted the developers, and they gave me more information that they also thought about the comments, how it would be displayed. And after listening to their version, I created it so that the forum would be displayed in the gyrosection, that is, next to the number of students we will have the "Forum" field, and when clicking on it, it will take us to the very bottom of the page, where we will have the heading "Course Forum", and we can add a comment, that is, give it a title and write the comment itself and publish it, and below - the comments of other users, where we can either like this comment or provide a response.
I also made several versions of the progress line.

Today I was given some edits - to make a common container, add a bookmark button to the right side next to the number of students who have completed the course, fix the progress line. The main point is to figure out how to save the code.














Requirements 5

 This should be a page design for the online platform Game Academy, where on the left side there is a panel with the main pages of this site, which does not move, such as:

- Home
- Courses E-Learning
- Pass

- Blog
- My Guide
- Max Analytics
- Admin Panel
- Lesson Library
 
The purpose of the site is to train new employees and familiarize experienced ones with new information.
The platform should be modern with the ability to switch the color theme (from light to dark).
On the left side there should be a menu that will indicate – Home, Courses, Learning Paths, Leaderboard, My Tests, Bookmarks, Analytics, Lesson Library, My Change Requests.
There should also be a change of theme from light to dark and vice versa.
The site should be in light colors. I will give a few examples. That is, it is not pure white; it should be in certain shades to look expensive.
 A gyro section with a photo taken on the background, this section contains a marker for whom this course is for (beginner, designer, programmer), a large bold title somewhere in half of the section, below it the description of this course is written in a smaller and normal font, under the description at the bottom of this section there should be a full-length block where the following will be written - course information, title and list along the block, how much time it takes to study the course, how many lessons, videos, presentations, what is the rating and how many people study this course (there should be an icon for each item). About the review, when you click on it, a modal window appears, where there is a list of everyone who has taken and completed the course, there should be an answer whether the person has taken this course, has started studying it or is studying it (this should be indicated with certain icons). Next, we divide the content into 70 and 30%. Where Seventy percent of the content, that is, the width, there should be a name, or rather the title of this block. These will be modules. Modules have the form of a certain card, that is, three by four.
And in this card there is a certain photo, on top of which the name of this module is written at the bottom. That is, "Module one", and the name of this module itself is written a little smaller. They are made in the form of four rows of module cards, if we have, for example, seven modules, we will have a button under them (with these 4 cards) the "more" button.
Where we have thirty percent of the content, there we should display information. That is, the courses that need to be taken will be as recommendations. So are the names of the rec-courses, recommended courses.
There should also be a photo, name, description. When hovering over this course, it should display how much time of lessons, videos, presentations, tests we have in this lesson, in this course.
Then we should go as a demarcation. That is, we will have blocks of the modules themselves next. That is, when clicking on the first module, we will be transferred to the information itself below. We will have a title, one module and its name. A small description.
This is about half of its possible content. There should be a small indent, that is, on the right side. This is already information that should be written about the number of lessons in this module.
The ability to switch the display format of these lessons. That is, that it will be either in the form of blocks, that is, that it will be in the form of a table, or in a line format.
We should also have the ability to display when hovering over the lesson itself what is included in this lesson. That is, what will be there: a video, a presentation, or, I don't know. That is, when hovering over the lesson card itself, this information should appear.
Information in the right corner of the trees. The time needed to complete this lesson should also be indicated. I told you how to display this format in a block format.
That is, we should have a large photo, well, three by four, and the name of this lesson should be displayed at the bottom of this photo.
When the lesson is completed, it will have a green outline. When it is in the line format, we should have a square video of the shower.
It can be a photo or video. If we have seventy percent of this content, and from that we have about thirty percent, which can be a video or a photo.
At the same time, you should display information about the lesson. Anastasia Dinei: That is, its name, a short description, a button to start the lesson, because it was already flipping to the next page.
There should also be information about how much is in the entire lesson. That is, presentations, tests, videos.


Requirements 4

This should be a page design for the online platform Game Academy, where on the left side there is a panel with the main pages of this site, which does not move, such as:

- Home
- Courses E-Learning
- Pass
- Rating
- Blog
- My Guide
- Max Analytics
- Admin Panel
- Lesson Library

Also at the bottom of this panel we have an avatar with a name and a light and dark theme switcher, as well as an exit button.
I need to design an open course page, where there will be a list of modules and lessons. I want to see two buttons on the left and right sides when opening the course at the very top: "Back" and "Edit".
The first content I want to see will be a slightly darkened photo. It will be the full width that we left. There should be a marker there, for whom it is for, for beginners or for programmers.
Under this photo, in large bold font, there should be a title and a small description under this title, written in smaller font.
I also want to see a long card on this photo, where the following information will be displayed. That is, we will have a heading, for example, “Course Information”. And there will be a list: how much time is needed for this course, how many lessons in this course, how many videos, presentations and tests.
At the very end there will be a rating for this course in stars.
Under all this information there is a line that shows the progress of learning. Under this text, under this block, the width is further divided into percentages of about seventy by thirty. Where thirty percent is, this should be a block with a title that suggests certain courses that are worth taking. That is, the recommendations themselves go. They go one under the other, and the block where the remaining percentages of width remain should be a list of lessons.
Where we have seventy percent left, I want to see a small filter, where we will have the name: module one, module two, module three and so on, it should all be in such a block. In the block there will be round photos, where there will be photos of the lessons. That is, we will have a round photo, and under it there will be the name of the lesson. Well, let it be lesson one, lesson two, lesson three and so on.
The next block. This should be when you open a selected lesson, and a window appears, where there is a larger circle on the left side. That is, it will be like a short video instruction from the mascot, what you will learn there today. On the left side we have the mascot. Then we step back a little from the circle to the right. We should have the name of this lesson, at the bottom a small description and a brand, for whom it is: beginners, developers, designers. That's it. And already at the bottom of this information there should already be general information about the lesson itself. So, for example, if this is a lesson on Dropbox, how do you install it? What is it?


Requirements 3

This should be a page design for the online platform Game Academy, where on the left side there is a panel with the main pages of this site, which does not move, such as:

- Home
- Courses E-learning
- Pass
- Leadboard
- Blog
- My text Book
- Max Analytics
- Admin Panel
- Lesson Library

Also at the bottom of this panel we have an avatar with a name and a light and dark theme switch, as well as an exit button.
I need to design an open course page, where there will be a list of modules and lessons. I want to see two buttons on the left and right sides when opening the course at the very top: "Back" and "Edit".
The first content I want to see will be a slightly darkened photo. It will be the full width that we have left. There should be a brand there, who is it for? That is, is it for beginners or is it for programmers.
A little lower in large bold font should be the title and a small description under this title, written in smaller font.
I also want to see a long card on this photo, where the following information will be displayed. That is, we will have a title, for example, "Course Information". And there will be a list: how much time is needed for this course, how many lessons in this course, how many videos, presentations and tests.
At the very end there will be a rating for this course in stars.
Under all this information there is a line that shows the progress of studying.
Under this text, under this block, the width is further divided into percentages of approximately seventy by thirty. Where there are thirty percent, this should be a block with a title that offers certain courses that are worth taking. That is, the recommendations themselves go. They go one under another, and the block where the remaining percentages of width remain should be a list of lessons.
That is, we have the title "Module One", and there is a card for the first lesson. We have a photo of the lesson. At the top right, we have a certain icon that is in this lesson, that is, it is made in the form of a presentation, text or code.
Under this photo there is a small indent, and this is the title of this lesson, as well as a place for an icon that indicates whether the lesson is completed or not, whether it has even been started or not. And each module is painted like this, how many lessons there are. I provide an example of a warframe, according to this example, make a page design, correct all the indents so that it is uniform because it was done in a hurry. You can also correct the colors. Do not use pure colors, it should look expensive (so that it is not clear what color it is, for example, white with a blue and gray tint)



Requirements 2

The purpose of the site is to train new employees and familiarize experienced ones with new information.
The platform should be modern with the ability to switch the color theme (from light to dark).
On the left side there should be a menu that will indicate – Home, Courses, Learning Paths, Leaderboard, My Tests, Bookmarks, Analytics, Lesson Library, My Change Requests.
The site should be in light colors. I will give a few examples. That is, it is not pure white; it should be in certain shades to look expensive. Some specific accents can be made dark. And if it is an accent, then you can make it a certain color. For example, completing a task – green, some error – red, etc.
Here, on the open course page, I want to see the name and title of the course at the top of the window, and under it some large photo that takes up 100% of the width
Where is either the splash screen of this course, or some small gif. Under it is a small description.
Under the photo of the course, certain cards in which there will be a photo of the module under it, a title and how many lessons are in it, and so that on the right side there is an icon that you click on and a list of lessons appears (it appears LIKE an accordion), and the background becomes darker so that it is easier to navigate through the lessons.

Where is either the splash screen of this course, or some small gif. Under it is a small description.
On the right side, just where we have free space, there is a general list of lessons, that is, we will have one module, in the form of an accordion, there will be a small icon with the name of the module, so that you can click on this accordion, and sub-items of the lessons themselves will appear, when you click on a specific lesson, instead of the icon where we had a photo, information will be displayed and it will drop down like this.
Where there are lessons and modules, it will be fixed, that is, static, nothing will move anywhere.
When a specific lesson is opened, uh, where there was a branch with a description, there will be information about the lesson. And at the end of this lesson there should be some button, which, uh, after clicking which it would mean that the lesson has been completed.















Based on the documentation I provided, create a page for the course.

better, let's make some edits the appearance of the module cards should be the same size as the lesson cards and vice versa the lesson cards should be the same size as the module cards (on desktop) the progress line should not be on the modules, it should be under the hero section, i.e. the progress of the course itself (full width).

also enter all the information about the course and lessons as in the file about dropbox, and use my photos too, everything in English

in the gyro section of the photo, make it so that it becomes complete and nothing is cut off in height and width. where there is a list of modules, then make it so that the 4th module is visible after pressing the "more" button, we will have three basic modules, and to see other modules if there are more of them, you need to press the more button. Remove the progress line in the modules, we should only have a general one from the course. where there is a module, there should be a photo and above it from the bottom it says module 1 and under it the name of the module - this is written on the photo of the module. Also add a photo to the lessons, and the video icon, prezi or whatever is used in the lesson, put under the number of minutes what is detailed for the lesson - it should also be on a white background like this.

What happened to the photos, why aren't they showing up?

I'll check the console logs and examine the image paths to see why the photos aren't displaying.

I can see the issue - the image paths are using /src/assets/ which is incorrect. In Vite/React, images in the src folder need to be imported or referenced correctly. Let me fix the image paths.

Edited
src/pages/CoursePage.tsx
Let me check the current file content and add the missing imports:

Fixed the image imports - all photos should now display correctly by properly importing the image assets instead of using incorrect path references.

Great, let's do it next, in the gyro section where the number of students is written to the left of this, make another point - forum, and when you click on this point, it will jump to the bottom of the page where under the general list of lessons there is a block with comments, where you write the title of this comment (for example, someone found an error in a word) and the explanation-comment itself, other people can like the comment and give a response to this comment (you can only give a response to a happy comment with a title).

before the general list of course modules, put a block there - there should be a video of the course with a mascot - a shark.

where the progress at the beginning of it put our mascot - a shark, as they do in games when the progress increases, the mascot moves with it, I want to make the shark go.

also in the gyro section opposite the level put an icon to save this course (on the right side of the section)

I wrote that our mascot is a shark that I made earlier, make a video block in the form of a card for the entire possible width - 70%, so that there is only video. At the end and where the forum is, make another place where people can write this comment, that is, a place for the name and the comment itself, make it definitely before all the comments.

and lastly, the list of modules, remove the button that shows more, make them in one row, with the same dimensions, just add a button with which you can scroll through them - swipe to the sides

I'll update the video block to be a card with the shark mascot, add a comment form to the forum, and make the modules horizontally scrollable with navigation buttons.
